# 16bit-Assembler
I create a program that convert like assembly language into binary.
this binary file run in my 16bit-Computer here https://github.com/habbochabbo21/16bit-Computer.
# how it work
first compile the code using c compiler like GNU gcc :
gcc ./16bit-Assembler/src/main.c -o ./16bit-Assembler/build/assembler

in your terminal or powershell, run this command
./16bit-Assembler/build/assembler [Path_of_file.ass] [Patn_of_file.bin]
