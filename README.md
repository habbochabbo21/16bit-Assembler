# 16bit-Assembler
I create a program that convert like assembly language into binary.
this binary file run in my 16bit-Computer here [16bit-Computer](https://github.com/habbochabbo21/16bit-Computer).
# how it work
first compile the code using c compiler like GNU gcc : 

`gcc ./16bit-Assembler/src/main.c -o ./16bit-Assembler/build/assembler`

in your terminal or powershell, run this command : 

`./16bit-Assembler/build/assembler path_of_file.ass path_of_file.bin`

replace `path_of_file.ass` with your Assembler file and `path_of_file.bin` with your binary file output.
